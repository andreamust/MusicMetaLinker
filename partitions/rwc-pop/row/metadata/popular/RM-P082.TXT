Once in a life time


Once you were my love, now just a friend
What a cruel thing to pretend
A mistake I made, there was a price to pay
In tears you walked away
Walked away

When I see you hand in hand with some other
I slowly go insane
Memories of the way we used to be
Oh God, please stop the pain

I took for granted, all the times that you would be
Smiling here, ever so close to me
And now I know your kiss is the thing I miss

 ÅñOh, once in a life time
  Nothing can last forever
  I know it's not too late
  Would you let this be our fate?
  I know you'd be right but please stay
  Don't walk away

I'm not a saint, you know I'm just a man
Oh babe, please understand
You are the best thing that ever happend in my life
Please look me in the eyes

I took for granted, all the times that you would be
Smiling here, ever so close to me
And now I know your kiss is the thing I miss

  ÅñRepeat

Losing it, finding it
Losing it, finding it, loving it all the while
I know my mind is fading
Its there if we can take one step at a time
One step at a time

  ÅñRepeat

  ÅñRepeat
  Don't walk away
  Don't walk away

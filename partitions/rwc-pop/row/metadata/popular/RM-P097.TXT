Don't Lie To Me

I cannot believe
I've seen you here tonight
A girl so beautiful 
Hanging from your arm
Don't kiss me I'm telling you
I never wanna see you again

You don't need to say goodbye.
I just ask one thing now
Wipe out all your memories 
Don't you try to change my mind
Get out of my life

*	Don't lie to me!  I know your heart is untrue
   Don't make me suffer any more ! 
   Don't try to change to me now
   I've made up my mind.
   My last pretence at pride !
   I really need you to go

You told me that you loved me
For now and all time
You promised me the truth
Never to lie  But I see you aren't what you seem
I want you to leave me 

You don't need to say goodbye.
I just ask one thing now
Wipe out all your memories 
Don't you try to change my mind
Get out of my life

* (Repeat)

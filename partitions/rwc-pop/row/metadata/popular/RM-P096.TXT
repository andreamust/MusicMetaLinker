Weekend


EVERYBODY DANCIN' THROUGH THE NIGHT
EVERYBODY SHAKIN' ON THE EARTH
EVERYBODY LAUGHIN' ANYTIME
MAKE IT, MAKE IT, MAKE ME HAPPY

EVERYBODY WALKIN' IN THE PARK
EVERYBODY RUNNIN' TO THE DISCO
EVERYBODY STOPPIN' HEART BEAT
EVERYBODY HEARIN' SAD VOICE

I WANNA BE THE CRAZY GIRL
DO YOU WANNA BE THE FOOLISH BOY?
I WANNA BE THE NUMBER ONE
TAKE IT, TAKE IT, TAKE IT EASY

I NEVER KNOW YOUR HISTORY
DO YOU NEVER KNOW THAT STORY?
I NEVER EVER LASTING LOVE
TELL ME, TELL ME, TELL ME, TELL ME,
TELL ME "MORE LOVE YOU"

  DON'T SAY NO, YOU'LL GO
  DON'T SAY "I WANNA COME BACK"
  I'M CRYING. MAKE ME CRY
  CAN'T YOU SMILE WITH ME?

I MISS YOU WEEKEND
THINK ABOUT YOU EVERYTIME
DON'T YOU KNOW? HEART IS ALWAYS BY YOUR SIDE
I CAN SING A SONG FOR YOU AND ME
CAUSE BE HAPPY AND I AM FEELIN' BABY

I MISS YOU SUNDAY
THINK ABOUT YOU MONDAY
EVERYTIME HEART IS ALWAYS IN YOUR MIND
I CAN SING A SONG FOR YOU AND ME
BE MORE HAPPY AND  JUST SAY "I'M FALLIN' WITH YOU"

  
EVERYBODY WORKIN' AT OFFICE
EVERYBODY PLAYIN' AT HOME
EVERYBODY FIGHTIN' IN THE GAME
MAKE IT, MAKE IT, MAKE ME GROOVY

I NEVER KNOW YOUR TRUE HEART
DO YOU NEVER KNOW THAT STORY?
I NEVER EVER LASTING LOVE
TELL ME, TELL ME, TELL ME, TELL ME,
TELL ME "MORE LOVE YOU"

  DON'T SAY NO, YOU'LL GO
  DON'T SAY "I WANNA COME BACK"
  I'M CRYING. MAKE ME CRY
  CAN'T YOU SMILE WITH ME?

I MISS YOU WEEKEND
THINK ABOUT YOU EVERYTIME
DON'T YOU KNOW? HEART IS ALWAYS BY YOUR SIDE
I CAN SING A SONG FOR YOU AND ME
CAUSE BE HAPPY AND I AM FEELIN' BABY

I MISS YOU SUNDAY
THINK ABOUT YOU MONDAY
EVERYTIME HEART IS ALWAYS IN YOUR MIND
I CAN SING A SONG FOR YOU AND ME
BE MORE HAPPY AND JUST SAY "TOO MUCH I LOVE YOU"


I MISS YOU WEEKEND
THINK ABOUT YOU EVERYTIME
DON'T YOU KNOW? HEART IS ALWAYS BY YOUR SIDE
I CAN SING A SONG FOR YOU AND ME
CAUSE BE HAPPY AND I AM FEELIN' BABY

I MISS YOU SUNDAY
THINK ABOUT YOU MONDAY
EVERYTIME HEART IS ALWAYS IN YOUR MIND
I CAN SING A SONG FOR YOU AND ME
BE MORE HAPPY AND  JUST SAY "I'M FALLIN' WITH YOU"

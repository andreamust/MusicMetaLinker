Life


show me the magic
show me the truth in the world
need to find the secret
I wish to see the Jesus Christ

I've been waitin'
I've been dreamin' all about you
don't leave me standin' here alone in the dark
I'm gonna find the secret door

I'm left my body
I had a none in the night

people everywhere need a little bit of place
find the truth in what you see, don't give you up
understanding of your life

(La la la... La la la...)

tomorrow never knows
cause I keep running to long heaven's lord

(but) never ending story had an ending after all
it hurts you when you fall

time after time, I losing faith
and losing left of my days

but I'm beginning to feel again
give me something more

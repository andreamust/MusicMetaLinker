Doing That Thing

Walk the walk	   Come and go
Talk the talk	 Don't you know
If we work together - go with the flow -
We could be swimming in dough?

Everybody's got to do their thing
There's no time for hanging around
Everybody's got to play the game
Everybody's going to town

*	Hey! Why don't you join?
It's easier than you think,
Reaching for the big brass ring
Everybody is doing that thing!

Race the clock	I got to score
Work or play	Back for more
Only true believers rise to the top,
Licking the cream of the crop

Everybody wants a trophy shelf
Everybody's running a scheme
Everybody wants to prove themselves
You and I can share in the dream

* (Repeat)

Make your plans	Set your sights
Pad the nest 	Day and Night
When you catch the fever, just like the rest
You can take a shot at success

Everybody wants to beat the street
Looking for a piece of the pie
Everybody wants a front row seat
But it all and then let it ride!

* (Repeat)

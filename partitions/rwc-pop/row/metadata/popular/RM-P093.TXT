Sweet Dreams


I remember when we first met  Back in 'ninety eight
You were shining like a star
I could tell you liked me and now boy did I like you!
Da da dood da da
Da da dood da da 
You made me come alive
Da da dood da da
You made me sing

  *	Yes I know, You'll always love me but
       Sometimes I can't believe 
       I could be so lucky
       To have someone special make me so complete
       You are the boy of my dreams
       Boy of my sweet dreams 


You should really understand
My commitment to my man
He makes me happy every day
Even though you're far away
I won't forget you boy no way
Da da dood da da
Da da dood da da 
You are my only love
Da da dood da da
You make me smile

* (Repeat)

Come closer now
Let me snuggle up to you
Only you and only me
In love for all eternity
Don't forget it now my sweet boy

* (Repeat Å~ 2)

RM-P099.TXT

Once and For All


Love, light
So sure, yet whimsical
You're sensual
And cool as a breeze
An exersion of ease
So invincible

Time, space
So long, unseperable
We disengage
And with sympathy
A slight tragedy
Unimaginable

 ÅñHeavenly, laced in luxury
  And like no ordinary movement
  It's a symphony
  And try my best to improve
  Strike the ground as if to prove
  In a wink of an eye
  It'll change your life
  Now for once and for all


In, out
We turn to catch our breath
With, without
We flow with the tide
We swallow our pride
And experience

  ÅñRepeat

  ÅñRepeat

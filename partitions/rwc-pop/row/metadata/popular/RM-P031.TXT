RM-P031.TXT

Moving Round and Round


Sit on their couches                                         
Oh!  I stupidly happy                                              
And so dear public I`m here to confess                  

I stupidly happy                                                  
I stupidly happy                            
I stupidly happy                                             
I stupidly happy                                           

 
While this one is slowly washed away                          
Season cycle moving round and round                     
A hit song is flowing to the town            
Until my head goes spinning round                     

When their logic grows cold  
And all thinking done    
But, Trying to take this all in, I got                     
No nothing not wrong  
Everything'fine            
But The visions I had just faded away  

I'm not of the fact that I don't know how to write a big hit song                  

But I know one thing 
And I love you   
But I know one thing 
And I love you  

While this one is slowly washed away                 
Season cycle moving round and round              
Do you know hear me anymore
Until my head goes spinning round                                               
           
While this one is slowly washed away                 
Season cycle moving round and round                     
A hit song is flowing to the town         
Until my head goes spinning round and round   

Sit on their couches                                         
Oh! I stupidly happy                                         
And,so dear public 
moving round and round

Angel Baby


Love Is A Energy. Love Is You.
Thinking Of You Everytime, Everywhere
Listen To My Voice, Close Your Eyes
Always Remember Your Love Is True

World Is Like A Heaven To Me
If Only You Live With Me Now
Come Back To Piece Of My Place, I Said You
"To Take This Love So Plain And True" Uh-

  Angel Baby, You're Like A Angel Baby
  Angel Baby, I Want You, Angel Baby
  Angel Baby, You're Like A Angel Baby
  Angel Baby, I Want You, Angel Baby
  Won't You Be My Girl
  Need You


Love Is A Fantasy. Lovin' You.
Thinking Of You Everytime, Everywhere
Hearing To My Voice, Call Your Name
Always Remember Your Heart's Beautiful

World Is Like A Dream To Me
If Only You Live With Me Now
Come Back To Piece Of My Place, I Said You
"To Take This Love So Joy And Pain"

  Angel Baby, You're Like A Angel Baby
  Angel Baby, So Good Luck, Angel Baby
  Angel Baby, You're Like A Angel Baby
  Angel Baby, So Good Luck, Angel Baby
  Won't You Be My Girl
  Love You

Sky Is Blue
I Stay Here
There Was A Time When Alone

  Angel Baby, You're Like A Angel Baby
  Angel Baby, I Want You, Angel Baby
  Angel Baby, You're Like A Angel Baby
  Angel Baby, I Want You, Angel Baby
  Won't You Be My Girl
  Need You
